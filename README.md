This repository contains scripts in R and python, as well as anonymised data files related to an analysis project of emotion perception in Schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. The experimental results were obtained from a Genetic Algorithm (GA) -inspired facial expression generation task that measures a subject's ideal representation of different target emotions.

- A csv file called "TMS-EEG_additional_data.csv" in the "extra_data" folder has been removed from github due to the sensitive nature of the information.
